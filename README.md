# Straberry-Stacker
Self Project For simulation of drone in Gazebo
# Theme description
Commercial strawberry harvesting necessitates expert labour. The picker must swiftly identify any ripe strawberries on a plant, select them, and pack the berries into boxes all at the same time. This is labour for the employees as well as bad for the farm's overall efficiency.

The aim is to build a multi-drone system for picking strawberry boxes from a field and stacking them onto a transport trailer. A total of 6 incremental tasks starting from the installation to the final solution to the problem are detailed here.
